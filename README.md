# Altium Schematic Document Parser #

This is a Python command-line script that can
parse Altium schematic (\*.SchDoc) files, convert them
to SVG images, or display them in a window. It is incomplete and there are
probably many schematic elements and settings that it does not (yet)
understand.

The schematic file format has been documented somewhat in [format.md](
format.md).
